<h2 class="t2" >Introduction to 'The interplay between technology and society'
</h2><p class="t3">In the video, Hanne Cecilie discusses how a mobile phone can be understood as a technical device, a social device, as well as a phenomenon that can tell us something about the values in a society. How can a mobile phone be understood through the lense of your field of study and what do you think are the social implications of it?</p>

<h2>Technology, values, and society</h2>
<p>In this video, Knut Jørgen Vie, who is a philosopher working at Work Research Institute (AFI), <a href="https://www.oslomet.no/studier/tkd/dataingenior">OsloMet</a> , will talk about the relation between technology and values. Technology can influence societal values, but a change in societal values can also influence the development of technology.</p>
<p>New tools change our society, including our professional lives.  Anders Braarud Hanssen, senior advisor at Department of Technology, Art and Design, OsloMet, will reflect on this in the following video.</p>
<br>
<h2>Reflection task</h2>


<div class="imagetopic">

  <img src="topi2.jpg" alt="">
</div>


<p>Think about the development of a technology that is relevant to your field of study. If you are studying health science, this could be biotechnology, if you are studying computer engineering this could be an application of machine learning, and if you are becoming a teacher, this could be a digital technology used in the classroom. Is the development of this technology connected to a change in societal values? How? Do you approve of this change, or do you have concerns?

<h2>The politics of infrastructure</h2>
<p>Societies develop infrastructures to support different tasks, such as the distribution of electricity, transportation, and communication. At the same time, infrastructures shape societies in important ways, by enabling and promoting some practices and some categories for classification and excluding others. This means that infrastructures are not neutral constellations, but have political consequences. These issues will be discussed in the following video by Hanne Cecilie Geirbo, Associate Professor at Department of Computer Science, OsloMet.
  Contemporary society relies heavily on the Internet functioning at all times and most places. In this video, Kyrre Begnum, Associate Professor at Department of Computer Science, OsloMet, will tell us about how Netflix developed the "chaos monkey" to make sure that their service recovers swiftly from breakdown. 

  Reflection task

The Internet has grown into a ubiquitous infrastructure that societies all over the world are increasingly reliant on. To which extent and how does the internet have political consequences? Note down some examples and discuss with your colleagues.

In the first video in this sub-module, Hanne Cecilie mentions the Colombian city Medellín, where the development of transportation infrastructure has been a means of improving the living conditions of marginalized groups. If you want to learn more about this, you can watch this video:

<h2>Introduction to 'Digital cities' and the welfare state</h2>
<p>In this module, we will look at digitalization in urban administration, health care, and welfare, and address opportunities and challenges related to this. In the introductory video, Hanne Cecilie Geirbo, Associate Professor at Department of Computer Science, OsloMet, will talk about how digital technology has changed the ways government and institutions can collect and process data, and communicate with citizens.</p>

<h2>Digitization of urban governance</h2>
<p>Digital technology has opened new ways of collecting data and new ways of processing data. This has expanded the possibilities for how data about a city can be gathered and how this data can be combined and analyzed to give insights that can be used in planning and administration. In this video, Marikken Wullf Wathne, Ph.D. candidate at NIBR - Norwegian Institute for Urban and Regional Research, will elaborate on how digital technologies are being used in what is commonly known as "smart city" - initiatives, and present some of the debates around the digitization of urban governance.

  Reflection task: Think about to which extent and how you, as a citizen or as a student or a professional, participate in one or more "smart city"-initiatives, as Marikken describes them in her video.</p>
